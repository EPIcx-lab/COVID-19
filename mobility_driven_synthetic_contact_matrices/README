Analyses were carried out in Python 3.8.18. The code is written here in the form of jupyter notebooks. Package requirements are listed at the beginning of each notebook. The code employs standard packages of common use in Python (numpy, pandas, scipy). 

To install Python and jupyter, see [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [here](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/stable/install.html). 

To run the code, open the folders _transmission_model_with_synthetic_matrices_ or _transmission_model_with_empirical_matrices_, and run each notebook according to the numbered ordered. Each notebook refers to a pandemic phase (historical strain and Alpha variant, Alpha and Delta variant, Delta and Omicron variant), and will output the trajectory of the daily number of hospitalizations over time. The code takes from ~2 to ~6 minutes to run 100 stochastic simulations locally on a MacBook Pro (Apple M3, 16GB memory), depending on the pandemic phase and model complexity.
