To run the branching process and obtain results on the effective reproduction number generated under the protocol choice “scenario” and the epidemic context defined by a set of other parameters, run the script generate_results.R after tuning the parameters as desired. 

The variable scenario takes integer values from 0 to 7 and each value denotes one protocol implemented in the above-mentioned paper.\ 
scenario = 0 denotes the scenario in absence of interventions\
scenario = 1 implements the Winter 2022 French protocol\
scenario = 2 implements the Spring 2022 French protocol\
scenario = 3 implements the Winter 2022 Belgian protocol\
scenario = 4 implements the Spring 2022 Belgian protocol\
scenario = 5 implements the Winter 2022 Italian protocol\
scenario = 6 implements the Spring 2022 Italian protocol\
scenario = 7 implements the Fall 2022 Italian protocol\
